The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n- A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n\n- The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.&quot;

On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\n\n- Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon&#39;s endless and undiscriminating hunger.\n\nif the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.&quot;

Any creature but the al-Aeshma that enters the dust devil must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it; any number of creatures may be restrained this way. At the start of a restrained creature&#39;s turn, it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the dust devil, including itself, by making a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, it moves to the nearest space outside the dust devil.&quot;

Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally.

The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath).

Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n\n- The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions.

Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can&#39;t create bright light in this area.\n\n- Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon&#39;s lair.

On a failure, the astral snapper consumes part of the host&#39;s internal organs, reducing the host&#39;s Constitution score by 1d4. The host dies if this reduces its Constitution to 0. The reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the astral snapper has been expelled. If the host&#39;s Constitution score is reduced to 0, the astral snapper exits the host&#39;s body in the Material Plane by tearing its way out through the abdomen. The astral snapper becomes completely corporeal as it exits the host, stepping out of the host at its full size.\n\nFrom the time the astral snapper succeeds on the initial dive into the host through the Astral Plane until the moment it emerges from the host&#39;s abdomen, it can be seen by any creature that can see into the Astral Plane-its head buried in the host&#39;s back.
